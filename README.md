# pt-boilerplate

Barebones and a little opinionated. This is meant to be a start for custom wordpress projects.

## Do this first

1. Search and replace *ptboilerplate* with *your-theme-name*.
2. Change the 'proxy' property to the url to local wordpress installation.

## How to use this
There are only two scripts in this boilerplate
- npm run build
    - Bundles, optimises for production
- npm start
    - Starts a dev server with browsersync

## What's in this boilerplate

- Javascript bundling with Babel and minification
- Sass processing
- Browsersync
- JS and CSS in a manifest file for cache busting
- Every Inter font style (Inter is the best font but you probably want to remove/replace them for speed sake)
